	  The shadow-utils package includes the necessary programs for
	  converting UNIX password files to the shadow password format, plus
	  programs for managing user and group accounts. The pwconv command
	  converts passwords to the shadow password format. The pwunconv command
	  unconverts shadow passwords and generates an npasswd file (a standard
	  UNIX password file). The pwck command checks the integrity of a password
	  and shadow files. The lastlog command prints out the last login times
	  for all users. The useradd, userdel, and usermod commands are used for
	  managing user accounts. The groupadd, groupdel, and groupmod commands
	  are used for managing group accounts.
